  "The Algoview Essential package contains classical and widely used trading indicators. The majority of these indicators are \"price action\" oriented, with a candlestick patterns finder, a powerful range patterns indicator (to easily find NR4/NR7 patterns for example), and the popular ThrustBars. The other indicators are also very popular, with the MACDBB which helps to get a better picture than a simple MACD, and the famous SuperTrend, which is an excellent tool to manage trailing stops. Six additional indicators will be added later in this package.

The other indicators are also very popular, with the MACDBB which helps to get a better picture than a simple MACD, and the famous SuperTrend, which is an excellent tool to manage trailing stops. Six additional indicators will be added later in this package. Trading is not easy, and nothing is black or white, but with these tools you will have a clearer view of what's happening on a market, it's up to you to use it in your favor!",
